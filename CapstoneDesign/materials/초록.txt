Identifiability of Linear Stuctural Equation Models with homogeneous and heterogeneous error variances

In this work, we consider the identifiability assumption of linear structural equation models (SEMs) in which each variable is determined by a linear function of its parents plus normally distributed error. It has been shown that linear structural equation models are fully identifiable if all error variances are the same or known. Hence, this work proves the identifiability of linear SEMs with both homogeneous and heterogeneous unknown error variances. Our new identifiability assumption exploits not only error variances, but edge weights; hence, it is strictly milder than prior work on the identifiability result. We further provide a structure learning algorithm that is statistically consistent and computationally feasible, based on our new assumption. The proposed algorithm assumes that all relevant variables are observed, while it does not assume faithfulness or a sparse moralized graph. We verify our theoretical findings through simulations, and compare our algorithm to state-of-the-art PC, GES, GDS and other linear SEM learning algorithms.
